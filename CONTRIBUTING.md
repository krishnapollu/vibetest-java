## üé® Coding Standards

### Java Code Style

- Use Java 17 features appropriately
- Follow Java naming conventions
- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Add Javadoc comments for public methods
- Keep methods small and focused

### Test Code Standards

- Use descriptive test method names
- Follow the `@MyTest` annotation pattern:
  ```java
  @MyTest(
      testCaseId = "TC-001",
      description = "Clear description of what the test does",
      author = "Your Name",
      tags = {"smoke", "regression"}
  )
  @Test
  public void testDescriptiveMethodName() {
      // Test implementation
  }
  ```

### Page Object Model

- Keep page objects focused on single pages
- Use meaningful locator names
- Implement proper encapsulation
- Add helper methods for common actions

### Logging

- Use `LoggerUtil.info()` for step logging
- Include screenshots with step logs: `"Step: action || screenshot: filename.png"`
- Log important test events and assertions

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Test Structure

1. **Setup**: Initialize test data and WebDriver
2. **Action**: Perform the test steps
3. **Verification**: Assert expected outcomes
4. **Cleanup**: Reset state if needed

### Test Data

- Externalize test data in `src/test/resources/data/`
- Use meaningful data file names
- Keep test data minimal and focused

### Locators

- Externalize locators in `src/main/resources/locators/`
- Use descriptive locator names
- Prefer stable locators (ID, name) over fragile ones (XPath)
